This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Rust when using raw pointers to modify vector elements.  The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.rs` presents a safer and more idiomatic alternative.  The unsafe code in `bug.rs` might lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if not handled correctly. The solution emphasizes safe and efficient methods for vector manipulation.
